"""Adversarial validation harness for the citation-grounding scorer.

Motivation: the citation scorer must not become an unvalidated oracle that
rewards citation-shaped prose. This module constructs adversarial cited-report
cases with KNOWN-correct expected behavior and checks that the scorer penalizes
them. It has two layers:

1. Pipeline layer (deterministic, CI-safe): run each case through an oracle judge
   that returns the case's ground-truth verdicts, and assert the scoring pipeline
   (aggregation, half-credit, precision/recall) converts correct verdicts into
   the expected scores. This proves the plumbing, GIVEN a correct judge. See
   tests/core/test_citation_validation.py.

2. Judge layer (needs OPENAI_API_KEY, run manually): run the same cases through
   real judges to test whether they ARE correct judges on these adversarial
   cases. Run `python -m olmo_eval.common.scorers.citation_validation` to sweep a
   ladder of judges; pass rung specs as args (`model` or `model:effort`, e.g.
   `gpt-5.5:low`) and `--repeat N` to average over runs (the gpt-5 series runs at
   temperature 1, so single runs are noisy).

The adversarial half needs no human labels (expected behavior is known by
construction). The complementary human-agreement study (does the scorer agree
with human citation-faithfulness labels on real scientific text) is scaffolded at
the bottom but needs labeled data; see plans/002_science_literature_evals.md.
