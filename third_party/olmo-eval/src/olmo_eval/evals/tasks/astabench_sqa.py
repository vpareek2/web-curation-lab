Question: """

# from astabench rubric.py:_assess_properties_jointly
INGREDIENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You will be given a question someone asked (in <question></question> tags) and the corresponding response (in <response></response> tags) given to them by an assistant.
        You will then be given an enumerated list of criteria by which to evaluate the response. Each criterion specifies requirements that the answer must satisfy. You will assign a score accordingly (see below).
        You will also be given a list of examples (in <examples></examples> tags, below each criterion) that illustrate the type of details that would satisfy the criterion. We do NOT expect any of the specified details to necessarily appear in the answer. These are strictly to be used as guidance for locating the answers that satisfy the set requirement.

        For each criterion, return a score of 0, 1 or 2 indicating how appropriate the response is based on the given criterion. 0 means the response does not meet the criterion, 1 means the response somewhat meets the criterion, 2 means the response perfectly meets the criterion. Judge only the specified aspect(s) delimited by the criterion, not any other qualities of the answer.

        Scoring Example 1:
        <question>Common medical NLP papers on clinical text benchmarks</question>
        <response>The application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to medical text presents tremendous opportunities for healthcare tasks such as prediction ... [TRUNCATED]</response>
        Criteria:
        <criterion>
        1. Detail the well-known medical NLP datasets
        <examples>
        i2b2 includes datasets focused on temporal relations in clinical narratives, CRAFT Corpus is a collection of 97 full-length, open-access biomedical journal articles with semantic and syntactic annotations.]
        </examples>
        </criterion>
        <criterion>
        2. ... [TRUNCATED]
        <examples>
        ...[TRUNCATED]
        </examples>
        </criterion>

        A 2 point answer would fully satisfy the criterion #1. For example, it would include specific names with some details of well-known medical datasets for ML like those mentioned in the examples.
        A 1 point answer would only partially satisfy the criterion #1. For example, a dataset (like those in examples) may be mentioned, but no detail would be provided. Or datasets may be simply listed without further discussion.
        A 0 point answer would not mention datasets at all.

        Scoring Example 2:
        <question>What are some of the documentation methods used in Linguistics fieldwork.</question>
        <response>Language documentation, also called documentary linguistics, is a specialized subfield of linguistics ... [TRUNCATED]</response>
        Criteria:
        <criterion>
        1. ... [TRUNCATED]
        <examples>
        ...[TRUNCATED]
        </examples>
        </criterion>
        <criterion>
        2. Cover elicitation techniques for capturing specific linguistic data.
        <examples>
        structured interviews, elicitations based on standard word lists, prompted speech tasks
        </examples>
        </criterion>

        A 2 point answer to criterion #2 would contain common elicitation techniques like (but not limited to) those mentioned in the examples. The answer specifics don't have to match exactly with the examples, but examples show the types of instances that would count towards satisfying the criterion.
        A 1 point answer to criterion #2 be incomplete in some way. For example, the answer might mention "elicitation sessions" during a discussion on audio recording, but it fails to specifically address the requirement. Or the answer gives a list of standard word lists in the answer as resources, but fails to tie this information to elicitation.
        A 0 point answer to criterion #2 would simply not include the discussion in any way. For example, if an answer focuses only on data handling (post elicitation) techniques, it would miss out on techniques for documentation interview itself.

        Scoring Example 3:

        <question>How do transformer models differ from recurrent neural networks (RNNs)?</question>
        <response>Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms to process input, while RNNs process input sequentially. Transformers are better at handling long-range dependencies in data because they don't rely on previous time steps to pass information. RNNs may suffer from vanishing gradients and have trouble with long-term dependencies.</response>
        Criteria:
        <criterion>
        1. Must compare how the architecture and data processing flow differ between transformers and RNNs. <examples>
        Transformers use parallel processing and self-attention; RNNs process input tokens one at a time in sequence. Transformers can look at the entire input sequence at once, while RNNs have to pass information step by step.
        </examples>
        </criterion>

        A 2 point answer would accurately and distinctly contrast both architecture and sequence-processing style of both model families (e.g., parallelism vs. sequential processing, use of self-attention vs. recurrence).

        A 1 point answer would provide a partial or imprecise comparison, perhaps only mentioning one difference, or being vague (e.g., "Transformers work differently from RNNs in how they process text" without further elaboration).

        A 0 point answer would explain only one architecture (e.g., only transformers), or describe both but fail to contrast them on the asked criteria.

        Return your result as a JSON object with a single key `scores` whose value is a list of objects, each having keys `criteria_idx`, `reasoning`, `score` and `evidence` from the text supporting the claim."""

# from astabench precision_eval.py:PrecisionEval
PRECISION_EVAL_PROMPT = """You are given a query and a corresponding long answer.

Goal: find irrelevant paragraphs in the answer. These are paragraphs that don't directly answer the query and shouldn't be in the answer.

For instance, if the query is about datasets for scientific question answering, a paragraph about multilingual question answering datasets that don't contain scientific text would be considered irrelevant.

Explicitly consider whether something may be indirectly relevant. For example, if the question is about the conditions of horses in South Africa, a paragraph about general animal welfare in South Africa is potentially relevant while not being precisely about horses. On the other hand, a paragraph about pig welfare in South Africa is irrelevant.

Note that subtle differences can make the text irrelevant to the query. For instance, text about scientific survey paper generation is not relevant to a query about automatic paper review generation. Even though they seem related, they are about very different tasks.

Also, useful background in general is relevant. If the question is about an approach to creating liver-related proteins, some information about liver-related proteins could contextualize other parts of the answer. If a paragraph contextualizes another part of the answer, then it is relevant.

Go through the answer and output a list of irrelevant paragraphs. Every single paragraph needs to be considered, one by one. Our goal is to catch all the irrelevant paragraphs, so please be thorough.
Return your result as a JSON object with a single key `irrelevant_paragraphs` whose value is a list of objects, each having keys `reason`, and `answer_text` as follows:
{{"irrelevant_paragraphs":[
{{
"reason": "discuss why something is irrelevant (not indirectly relevant)",
"answer_text": "exact ENTIRE paragraph (not just a part of it) from the answer that is irrelevant"
}},
