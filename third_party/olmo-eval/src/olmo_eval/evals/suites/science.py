"""Science evaluation suites.

This module keeps the existing GPQA convenience suites while also defining a
non-overlapping science hierarchy for aggregate reporting.

Design rules for the ``science:*`` hierarchy:
1. ``science:all`` should contain each underlying task spec exactly once.
2. Reuse existing suites where they are already coherent and non-overlapping.
3. Prefer subject-sliced GPQA tasks inside the hierarchy so biology, chemistry,
   and physics live in separate domain suites without also including the
   full-subset GPQA tasks.
4. Provide an execution-oriented split between judge-free and judge-dependent
   tasks so large science runs can be staged in two passes.

The legacy ``gpqa`` / ``gpqa:mc`` / ``gpqa:bpb`` suites are retained as
convenience entry points, but they are intentionally not nested under
``science:all`` because they would duplicate the GPQA questions already
allocated to domain-specific suites.

Execution guidance:
- Use ``science:nojudge`` for the main science stack when you want to avoid
  external LLM-as-judge dependencies.
- Use ``science:judge`` for the judge-dependent science tasks.
- Use ``science:all`` only when you want both together as a single umbrella.

# Notes on composition:
# - science:core is the broad STEM / school-science layer.
# - science:biology owns the biology slice of GPQA plus the dedicated biology
#   benchmarks (LAB-Bench + GeneTuring via the biology suite).
# - science:physical owns only chemistry + physics GPQA slices, avoiding
#   duplication with science:core's broader STEM exams.
# - science:medicine uses med benchmarks plus medicine-heavy MMLU subjects, but
#   does not include ``medqa`` because it points at the same benchmark family as
#   ``medqa_en`` and would double-weight that content.
# - science:research groups scientific literature / evidence-use tasks.
# - science:nojudge / science:judge are execution helpers for running the full
#   science stack in two stages.
# - science:math groups mathematical reasoning tasks used in science-adjacent
#   evaluation.

# The members of science:research measure different things; read the per-metric
# tiers rather than the aggregate:
# - expertqa: agentic web-grounded attribution and on-topic precision of cited
#   long-form answers, not factual correctness against a reference. Like
#   litsearch, it needs a tool-providing harness (web_search_agent), so it sits
#   only in science:research, not science:judge / science:nojudge / science:all.
#   Its citation metrics additionally require the OpenAI judge at scoring time.
# - litsearch: an agentic retrieval smoke test (does a gold paper surface in live
#   Semantic Scholar results), distinct from the published fixed-corpus Recall@k.
# - litsearch_rerank: fixed-corpus reranking. The model reranks a frozen pool of
#   BM25-retrieved candidates per query, scored Recall@5/@20 over its own
#   selection: reproducible, judge-free, and tool-free. The BM25 retriever
#   Recall@k baseline comes from the offline build script, not this task.
#
# Note: litsearch (agentic) is intentionally only in science:research, not
# science:judge / science:nojudge / science:all. It needs an agentic
# tool-providing harness (semantic_scholar_snippet_search) rather than a judge,
# so it does not fit the judge/nojudge execution split and would score zero in a
# routine science:all run. litsearch_rerank has no such dependency and so does
# sit in science:nojudge (and thus science:all).
